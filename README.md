# Creating a REST API with Ruby on Rails.

This was created as an accompanyment to the following guide written on Medium:

https://medium.com/@oliver.seq/creating-a-rest-api-with-rails-2a07f548e5dc

No special gems were used, I simply installed Rails as an api and used PostgreSQL for the database.


## To run:

rails new rest-api-guide --api --database=postgresql
